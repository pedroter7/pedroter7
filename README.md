 - 🎮 gaming;
 - 🤖 AI;
 - 🗺️ language learning;
 - 📖 Reading & 📝 writing;

I speak Portuguese, English, some Spanish, some Hungarian and a little bit of German and French.

### Some projects 📂

 - [My personal portfolio]([https://github.com/pedroter7/portfolio](https://pedroter7.github.io/portfolio/)): this is my welcome card. I developed it using React and Material UI library. The project also feats a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub workflows. You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/pedroter7/portfolio).
 - [Reactive Floating Point Game](https://github.com/pedroter7/reactive-floating-point-game): this is my most recent project. I developed a simple game based on the Flappy Bird game using React in order to put into practice what I have learned.
 - On a daily basis I need to write scripts to do something for me. I decided that I would put [the most useful scripts into a repository](https://github.com/pedroter7/useful_scripts).
 - [File-Genx](https://github.com/pedroter7/file-genx) is not a big deal but I like it because it is my first project using Python that involved building a desktop GUI. Recently I quickly developed a CLI-only version that was handy when I needed to test a file-transfering software.
 - [My Note](https://github.com/pedroter7/mynote) is the product of some experimentation with Gtkmm, building GUIs and writing multi-platform desktop apps with C++. It's very simple and lacks some functionality, but I like it 😛

### Collaboration 👯

All my projects are always open to collaboration.

I'm looking to collaborate on OSS projects that are related to data science, k8s, machine learning, automation... My favorite languages are C#, JS/TS, Java and Python. I like mobile development too.
