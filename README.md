### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Pedro. Currently working as Software Developer Intern and majoring in Computer Science @ Universidade Federal do ABC. Some things that I really like:

 - 🚴 cycling;
 - 💻 programming;
 - 🎮 gaming;
 - 🤖 AI (though I'm new to it);
 - 🗺️ language learning;

I speak 🇧🇷 Portuguese, 🇬🇧 English, 🇭🇺 Hungarian, :es: and a little bit of 🇩🇪 German.

### What am I currently working on? 🧰

 - A [Java library to encapsulate digital/graphical units](https://github.com/pedroter7/digital-units): recently I've worked in a few projects where dealing with units in Strings were a constant need so I decided that I would write a small library to make things easier.

### Some projects 📂

 - [Reactive Floating Point Game](https://github.com/pedroter7/reactive-floating-point-game): this is my most recent project. I developed a simple game based on the Flappy Bird game using React in order to put into practice what I have learned.
 - On a daily basis I need to write scripts to do something for me. I decided that I would put [the most useful scripts into a repository](https://github.com/pedroter7/useful_scripts).
 - [File-Genx](https://github.com/pedroter7/file-genx) is not a big deal but I like it because it is my first project using Python that involved building a desktop GUI. Recently I quickly developed a CLI-only version that was handy when I needed to test a file-transfering software.
 - [My Note](https://github.com/pedroter7/mynote) is the product of some experimentation with Gtkmm, building GUIs and writing multi-platform desktop apps with C++. It's very simple and lacks some functionality, but I like it 😛

### Collaboration 👯

All my projects are always open to collaboration.

I'm looking to collaborate on OSS projects that are related to data science, k8s, machine learning, automation... My favorite languages are C++, Java and Python. I like mobile development too.
