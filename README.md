### Some projects 📂

 - [My personal portfolio](https://pedroter7.github.io/portfolio/): this is my welcome card. I developed it using React and Material UI library. The project also feats a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub workflows. You can see the source code [here](https://github.com/pedroter7/portfolio).
 - [MagicShelfApi](https://github.com/pedroter7/MagicShelfApi): a public API written in aspnet core that allows anyone to store objects in a virtual shelf, leave comments about those objects and remove objects from the shelf retrieving the object's data.
